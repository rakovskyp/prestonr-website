          I'm a Computer Science and Business graduate from Northeastern
          University. In my spare time, I'm really interested in building
          things, working out, and reading. If I'm passionate about anything,
          it's learning. Whether through books, computer science projects, or
          friends â€“ I'm constantly learning and growing in one way or another.
